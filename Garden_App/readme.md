# Outdoor Garden App Project

## Goals:
### Provide data on plants
	Filter by plant, habit, type, then variety (ex: tomato, determinate/indeterminate, roma/cherry/grape/beefsteak, Paul Robeson)
	General information (ex: what is a tomato, average yield time, nutritional needs, etc.)
	Variety information (ex: Paul Robeson tomato, flavor profile, individual yield time, etc.)
### Provide data on growing season
	Dates of first and last frost (average from Farmer's Almanac vs. data of last 5 years)
	Plants started indoors vs. outdoors
	When to start seeds of different plants indoors and outdoors
### Water requirements
	Pull weather data on daily rainfall and temperature
	Determine if received water/week meets average needs
	Recommend watering schedule based on expected rainfall and temperature
### App integration with sensors
	Soil moisture
	Soil temperature
	Air humidity
	Air temperature
	Sunlight
	Arduino controlled water valve
