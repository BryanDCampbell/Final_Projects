# Outdoor Garden App (In Progress)

As a hobby gardener, I've never been truly satisfied with the features provided through available gardening apps. This project will be an attempt to consolidate and expand upon databases and tools that assist the gardening enthusiast.  

## Goals:
### Provide data on plants
	1. Filter by plant, habit, type, and variety (ex: tomato, indeterminate, beefsteak, Paul Robeson)
	2. General information (ex: scientific name, average yield/time, nutritional needs, spacing requirements, common diseases/pests, etc.)
	3. Variety information (ex: Paul Robeson tomato, flavor profile, individual yield time, etc.)
### Provide data on growing season
	1. Dates of first and last frost (average from Farmer's Almanac vs. data of last 5 years)
	2. When to start seeds indoors and/or outdoors based on zone/zip code
	3. Send notifications/set calendar reminders about when to plant/harvest
### Curate list of plants in personal garden
	1. Bookmark plants from dropdown menu selections
	2. Plants that user would like to grow
	3. Plants that have been started
	4. Plants that are currently in the ground
	5. Plants that will be started as season progresses/succession planting
### Water requirements
	1. Pull weather data on daily rainfall and temperature
	2. Determine if received water/week meets average needs
	3. Recommend watering schedule based on expected rainfall and temperature
### Soil maintenance
	1. Fertilizers
	2. Soil amendments (ex. bone meal)
	3. Mulch applications
### App integration with sensors
	1. Soil moisture
	2. Soil temperature
	3. Air humidity
	4. Air temperature
	5. Sunlight
	6. Arduino controlled water valve
### Expand database to include trees and flowers
