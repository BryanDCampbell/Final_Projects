# Outdoor Garden App Project (In Progress)

## Goals:
### Provide data on plants
	1. Filter by plant, habit, type, and variety (ex: tomato, indeterminate, beefsteak, Paul Robeson)
	2. General information (ex: what is a tomato, average yield time, nutritional needs, etc.)
	3. Variety information (ex: Paul Robeson tomato, flavor profile, individual yield time, etc.)
### Provide data on growing season
	1. Dates of first and last frost (average from Farmer's Almanac vs. data of last 5 years)
	2. Plants started indoors vs. outdoors
	3. When to start seeds of different plants indoors and outdoors
### Curate list of plants in garden
	1. Bookmark plants from dropdown menu selections
	2. Plants that are started indoor
	3. Plants that are currently in the ground
	4. Plants that will be started as season progresses
### Water requirements
	1. Pull weather data on daily rainfall and temperature
	2. Determine if received water/week meets average needs
	3. Recommend watering schedule based on expected rainfall and temperature
### Soil maintenance
	1. Fertilizers
	2. Soil amendments (ex. bone meal)
	3. Mulch applications
### App integration with sensors
	1. Soil moisture
	2. Soil temperature
	3. Air humidity
	4. Air temperature
	5. Sunlight
	6. Arduino controlled water valve
